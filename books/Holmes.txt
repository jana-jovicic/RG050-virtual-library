“My mind," he said, "rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. 
I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession, or rather created it, 
for I am the only one in the world.” 
        - Arthur Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four  


“Dr. Watson's summary list of Sherlock Holmes's strengths and weaknesses: 
"1. Knowledge of Literature: Nil. 
2. Knowledge of Philosophy: Nil. 
3. Knowledge of Astronomy: Nil. 
4. Knowledge of Politics: Feeble. 
5. Knowledge of Botany: Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons generally. Knows nothing of practical gardening.
6. Knowledge of Geology: Practical but limited. Tells at a glance different soils from each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what 
part of London he had received them. 
7. Knowledge of Chemistry: Profound. 
8. Knowledge of Anatomy: Accurate but unsystematic. 
9. Knowledge of Sensational Literature: Immense. He appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century. 
10. Plays the violin well. 
11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman. 
12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.”
